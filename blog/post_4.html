                    <p> 
                        Where should I start. . . . 
                        <br><br>
                        College, classroom, books or the beautiful girls/ handsome boys in college.
                        <br><br>
                        For some engineering was a passion and for others just a choice.
                        <br><br>
                        Morning 9:30-2:30 class, engineering is the best field to learn and have successful future. Teachers are very liberal! Attendance tho free hai.
                        <br><br>
                        Is it so? That's what we see in movies! (Myth).
                        <br><br>
                        Reality check :- Morning 8:30-5:30 class, school had better timing. Everything is taught what's in syllabus but Question paper are always out it (syllabus).
                        <br><br>
                        4Years 40Subjects 400Experiment 4,000Assignments and 40,000Hours! Normal Human can't do it. Those super heroes are Engineers. (Please don't make us regret over it)
                        <br><br>
                        We Have 100% of attendance in only one place ( any guess). . . . . . . . ?
                        <br><br>
                        Of course Xerox shop! I believe Xerox shop has 100% attendance than class room and they earn more than food stalls.
                        <br><br>
                        I guess everyone knows Bermuda Triangle,Where everything disappearance,My brain is just like that.
                        <br><br>
                        We learn every language like C, C++, JAVA other than English. You know good English then you can crack placement easily.
                        <br><br>
                        Saal mein ek bar cultural festival aata hai uske liya bhi professor se bheek mangni padti hai.
                        <br><br>
                        Dog's can enter campus easily than an engineer entering without an ID.
                        <br><br>
                        Engineers are Masters. They master from control C to control V.
                        <br><br>
                        Where semester notes are thicker than ramayana Or any other books.
                        <br><br>
                        Agar engineering main ek bhi backlog nah ho tho vo engineer nahi hai.
                        <br><br>
                        Teachers used to teach for months and friends in one night.
                        <br><br>
                        The more you write the more marks you get is always the best logic to pass any exam.
                        <br><br>
                        From writing your seniors assignment to your assignment engineering changed everything.
                        <br><br>
                        And nobody literally nobody pack their bag faster than hostilities.
                        <br><br>
                        Mess food and hostilities are best friends ðŸ˜‚.
                        <br><br>
                        You remember learning chemistry right! Salt Analysis, I still don't know where and why to use it... I always Imagined my life as an engineer like the one in 3 Idiots movie, par hum tho ek hi idiot hai.
                        <br><br>
                        United we stand, Divided we fall.
                        <br><br>
                        It's said engineering is the master of unemployment.
                        <br><br>
                        nearly 80 % ofÂ engineeringÂ graduates inÂ IndiaÂ are not employable. Basic Reason company gives is that engineers are lacking of experience.
                        <br><br>
                        College needs Full attendance it doesn't matter for overall development. Just give a mass production in end of the year.
                        <br><br>
                        Because of poor academic infrastructure The students are suffering yet they don't take a stand against it.
                        <br><br>
                        Ab tho online classes chalu hogaya hai
                        <br><br>
                        Oh wa ( they want us to study lol)
                        <br><br>
                        Abe unhen kya pata ki ham engineering Self study /group study mein pass hue hain.
                        <br><br>
                        Aage online classes lekar bewa koof log.
                        <br><br>
                        We are divided by branch, class etc but the last day of our college life where answer sheets are snatched not thinking how the paper was! But thinking that identity card has reached expiry date.
                        <br><br>
                        Those 4 years are dearly missed and undoubtedly the most enthused period of our life time.
                        <br><br>
                        Cheers to every engineers who realise that it's time for change. Let the upcoming engineers don't suffer.
